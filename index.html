        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am from Gilbert, Arizona (gratuitous&#127797;) and am currently studying Computer Science 
          with an emphasis in <span>&#x2728; Bioinformatics &#x2728;</span> at Brigham Young University. 
          My passion for coding has only been recently discovered, but as I delve further and futher 
          into the world of computers, I have become more and more hooked. Currently the majority of my
          experience is in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=C%2B%2B">C++</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my other passions include rats, Twilight, and being better than everyone else. 
          I pinpoint this to my childhood where good grades and being responsible were often 
          rewarded by the envy and admiration of my peers. I hope they are well, because 
          I certainly am.

        <p>
          I am pair programming with Isaac Thompson. 
          We are creating a web application to help users learn the Deseret Alphabet. 
          The repository for this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/imthomp/startup">here</a>,
          and you can <a href="https://startup.chickenlittle.click">play it here</a>.

          "The year is 1850. The Latter-day Saints have now lived in the Salt Lake Valley for 3 years. 
          The Latter-day Saint prophet Brigham Young saw that among the children being born and 
          the immigrant converts coming to the area that it was difficult for them to learn the 
          English language. He sought language reform in the form of a consistent phonetic 
          alphabet which he called the Deseret Alphabet. We are here to teach about this 
          lesser-known aspect of the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
          in game form! Website users will learn about the history of the alphabet, 
          learn the alphabet itself, and be able to compete with one another via a scoreboard.
