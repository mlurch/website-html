        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am from Gilbert, Arizona (gratuitous&#127797;) and am studying Computer Science 
          with an emphasis in &#x2728; Bioinformatics &#x2728; at Brigham Young University. 
          My passion for coding has only been recently discovered, but as I delve further and futher 
          into the world of computers, I have become more and more hooked. Currently the majority of my
          experience is with <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=C%2B%2B">C++</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my other passions include rats, Twilight, and being better than everyone else. 
          I pinpoint this to my childhood where good grades and being responsible were often 
          rewarded by the envy and admiration of my peers. I hope they are well, because 
          I certainly am.
